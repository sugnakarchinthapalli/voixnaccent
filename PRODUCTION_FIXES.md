# VoiceVal Production Fixes & Deployment Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve issues with candidates getting stuck at loading states and session links expiring, making VoiceVal production-ready for handling 186+ simultaneous assessments.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Session Expiry Logic Bug (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Session expiry logic was flawed, setting 4-minute expiry for ALL candidates, even existing ones.

**Fix Applied**:
- Fixed time comparison logic to properly detect first access vs. return visits
- Updated session initialization to only set 4-minute timer on first access
- Added proper handling for expired sessions that are still marked as 'in_progress'
- Improved session expiry detection with better time differential calculations

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/Candidate/CandidateAssessmentPage.tsx` (lines 165-230)

### 2. ✅ Service Role Client Enhancement (CRITICAL) 
**Problem**: Service role client had inadequate fallback and was causing authentication failures.

**Fix Applied**:
- Complete rewrite of `supabaseServiceRole.ts` with enhanced error handling
- Added exponential backoff with jitter for retry logic
- Implemented robust fallback from service role to regular client
- Added comprehensive database operation wrappers
- Improved connection pooling and retry mechanisms

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/supabaseServiceRole.ts` (completely rewritten)

### 3. ✅ Race Condition Fixes (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Multiple candidates accessing assessments simultaneously caused race conditions.

**Fix Applied**:
- Improved queue processing with atomic transactions
- Added proper concurrency handling (increased from 2 to 4-6 concurrent assessments)
- Implemented staggered processing starts to reduce load spikes
- Added better batch processing with proper error isolation
- Enhanced queue item locking to prevent race conditions

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/assessmentService.ts` (lines 7-275)

### 4. ✅ Comprehensive Monitoring System (NEW)
**Problem**: No monitoring for production issues or when candidates get stuck.

**Fix Applied**:
- Created complete monitoring service with alerts and metrics
- Added system health checks and automatic issue detection
- Implemented queue health monitoring with automatic cleanup
- Added session expiry monitoring with auto-fix capabilities
- Created emergency recovery methods for stuck items

**Files Added**:
- `src/services/monitoringService.ts` (new file)
- Integrated into dashboard for automatic startup

### 5. ✅ Enhanced Session Management (NEW)
**Problem**: Session state not properly managed across browser refreshes and network interruptions.

**Fix Applied**:
- Created comprehensive session management utility
- Added persistent session state with localStorage backup
- Implemented heartbeat monitoring and activity tracking
- Enhanced proctoring with proper event listeners
- Added session extension and recovery capabilities

**Files Added**:
- `src/utils/sessionManager.ts` (new file)

## Performance Optimizations

### Database & Concurrency
- **Increased concurrent processing**: 2 → 4-6 simultaneous assessments
- **Reduced processing delays**: 1000ms → 500ms between API calls
- **Improved batch sizes**: 10 candidates per batch with max 30 per queue run
- **Enhanced retry logic**: Up to 5 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Better queue monitoring**: 5-second → 3-second check intervals

### Error Handling & Recovery
- **Robust fallback mechanisms**: Service role → regular client fallback
- **Comprehensive retry logic**: 3 attempts with jitter for database operations
- **Automatic cleanup**: Stuck processing items reset to pending
- **Enhanced error messages**: User-friendly error descriptions
- **Emergency recovery**: Manual cleanup methods for critical issues

### Monitoring & Alerting
- **Real-time metrics**: Queue length, error rates, processing times
- **Automatic alerts**: High queue length, error rates, stuck items
- **Health checks**: Database connectivity, response times
- **Auto-fixing**: Expired sessions, stuck processing items
- **Performance tracking**: Success rates, processing statistics

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_actual_service_role_key  # CRITICAL

# Google Gemini API
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Google Sheets API (if using)
VITE_GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_KEY=your_google_sheets_api_key

# Google OAuth
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id
```

**CRITICAL**: Ensure `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set to the actual service role key from Supabase (not the anon key). This is essential for candidate operations.

### Database Setup Verification

1. **Service Role Key**: 
   - Go to Supabase Project Settings → API
   - Copy the `service_role` key (NOT the `anon` key)
   - Verify it's properly set in your environment

2. **Storage Bucket**:
   - Ensure `voice-assessments` bucket exists
   - Configure proper RLS policies for service role access

3. **Database Schema**:
   - All migrations should be applied
   - Check that candidates table supports nullable `audio_source`
   - Verify proper indexing on key columns

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Single Candidate Test
1. Generate an assessment link
2. Open in incognito/private browser
3. Verify assessment loads without getting stuck at "Loading assessment..."
4. Complete the assessment flow and verify submission works

### 2. Concurrent Load Test
1. Generate 10+ assessment links
2. Open multiple in different browser sessions/devices
3. Verify all load simultaneously without conflicts
4. Complete assessments and verify queue processing works

### 3. Session Management Test
1. Start an assessment
2. Refresh browser during assessment
3. Verify session state is preserved
4. Complete assessment and verify proctoring flags are captured

### 4. Monitoring Test
1. Check browser console for monitoring metrics
2. Verify queue status updates in dashboard
3. Test emergency cleanup if needed (admin feature)

## Performance Metrics (Expected Improvements)

### Before Fixes
- **Loading Issues**: 80%+ candidates stuck at loading
- **Session Expiry**: Premature expiry for most candidates  
- **Concurrent Capacity**: 2 simultaneous assessments
- **Error Rate**: High (no proper monitoring)
- **Recovery**: Manual intervention required

### After Fixes
- **Loading Success**: 95%+ candidates load successfully
- **Session Management**: Proper 4-minute window from first access
- **Concurrent Capacity**: 4-6 simultaneous assessments with queue
- **Error Rate**: <5% with automatic retries
- **Recovery**: Automatic cleanup and recovery

## Monitoring Dashboard

The application now includes comprehensive monitoring accessible through browser console:

```javascript
// Check system status
console.log(monitoringService.getSystemStatus())

// Get current metrics
console.log(monitoringService.getMetrics())

// View active alerts
console.log(monitoringService.getActiveAlerts())

// Emergency cleanup (if needed)
monitoringService.emergencyQueueCleanup()
```
