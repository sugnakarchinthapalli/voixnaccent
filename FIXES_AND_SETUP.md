# VoiceVal Assessment Tool - Fixes and Setup Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Assessment Loading Issue (Candidates stuck at "Loading assessment...")

**Root Cause**: The candidate assessment page was using the regular Supabase client instead of the service role client, causing RLS (Row Level Security) to block access since candidates are not authenticated users.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `CandidateAssessmentPage.tsx` to use `supabaseServiceRole` for all database operations
- Fixed fallback handling in `supabaseServiceRole.ts` when service role key is missing
- Added proper error logging and fallback to regular client when service role key is not configured

### 2. ✅ Audio Recording Submission Error ("no audio record found for candidate")

**Root Cause**: Missing or incorrectly configured service role key prevented file uploads and database updates during candidate submissions.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added missing `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment variable to `.env`
- Updated storage service to use service role client for candidate file uploads
- Enhanced error handling in storage operations with proper logging
- Fixed candidate record updates to use service role client

### 3. ✅ Removed Old Competency-Based System

**Cleaned up legacy code**:
- Removed `CompetencyScores` interface and all competency-related fields
- Updated database types to remove `competencies_targeted` from questions
- Cleaned up question service to remove competency-based creation
- Removed competency score imports and references throughout the codebase
- Updated types to focus on CEFR assessment system only

### 4. ✅ Service Role Key Implementation

**Enhanced service role handling**:
- Added graceful fallback when service role key is missing or placeholder
- Added proper warning messages for missing configuration
- Improved error handling across all services using service role client
- Added detailed logging for debugging authentication issues

## Required Setup Steps

### 1. Environment Variables

Add the missing service role key to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Supabase Service Role Key (for bypassing RLS on candidate submissions)
# Note: This should be the service_role key from Supabase, not anon key
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_actual_service_role_key_here
```

**To get your service role key**:
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings → API
3. Copy the `service_role` key (NOT the `anon` key)
4. Replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_HERE` in the `.env` file

### 2. Database Schema Updates (if needed)

The schema should already support the CEFR system, but ensure your questions table has:
- `competencies_targeted` column is optional (we've moved away from this)
- Focus on `difficulty_level`, `text`, `is_active` fields

### 3. Storage Bucket Setup

Ensure your Supabase storage bucket `voice-assessments` exists with proper policies:
- Bucket name: `voice-assessments`
- Public access for reading uploaded files
- Service role access for writing files

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Test Assessment Link Generation
1. Login to the dashboard
2. Go to "Generate Assessment" 
3. Add a test candidate
4. Generate the assessment link
5. Verify the link is created successfully

### 2. Test Candidate Assessment Flow
1. Open the generated assessment link in an incognito/private window
2. Verify the assessment loads without getting stuck on "Loading assessment..."
3. Allow camera and microphone permissions
4. Start recording and verify audio recording works
5. Complete the recording and submit
6. Verify submission completes without "no audio record found" error

### 3. Test Dashboard Functionality
1. Check that submitted assessments appear in the dashboard
2. Verify CEFR levels are displayed correctly
3. Confirm assessment details show proper CEFR analysis instead of competency scores

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Competency-Based)
- Questions had `competencies_targeted` arrays
- Assessments used `CompetencyScores` with individual skill ratings
- Complex scoring system with multiple competency dimensions

### After (CEFR-Based)
- Questions are simpler with just difficulty levels
- Assessments use CEFR levels (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2)
- Single comprehensive assessment with detailed analysis
- Cleaner data structure focused on language proficiency

## Security Improvements

### Authentication Flow
- **Staff Users**: Regular Supabase authentication for dashboard access
- **Candidates**: Service role authentication for assessment submission (bypasses RLS)
- **File Uploads**: Service role client for candidate file uploads
- **Database Operations**: Service role client for candidate-related database operations

### RLS (Row Level Security)
- Dashboard operations use authenticated user context
- Candidate operations use service role to bypass RLS restrictions
- Storage operations properly authenticated based on context

## Troubleshooting

### If candidates still can't access assessments:
1. Check that `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is correctly set
2. Verify the service role key has proper permissions in Supabase
3. Check browser console for detailed error messages
4. Ensure the assessment link format is correct (UUID)

### If audio uploads fail:
1. Verify storage bucket exists and has proper permissions
2. Check that service role client can write to storage
3. Ensure file size limits are appropriate
4. Check browser console for storage-related errors

### If CEFR assessments don't work:
1. Verify `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` is set correctly
2. Check that the Gemini service is accessible
3. Ensure the assessment service can process audio URLs
4. Check network connectivity to AI services

## Performance Considerations

- Service role operations bypass RLS for faster candidate operations
- Removed unnecessary competency calculations for better performance
- Streamlined data structures reduce database complexity
- Optimized file upload process with better error handling

## Next Steps

1. Test all fixes thoroughly in your development environment
2. Update your production environment variables
3. Monitor candidate assessment submissions for any remaining issues
4. Consider adding more detailed logging for production debugging

---

## Quick Fix Summary

1. ✅ **Add service role key** to `.env` file
2. ✅ **Removed competency system** - now uses CEFR only  
3. ✅ **Fixed candidate loading** - now uses service role client
4. ✅ **Fixed audio submission** - proper authentication for uploads
5. ✅ **Enhanced error handling** - better logging and fallbacks

The application should now work properly with candidates able to access assessments and submit recordings successfully!
